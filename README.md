# lbs-to-kgs-converter

This mini programme converts pounds to kilograms and vice versa.

okay so to whoever is reading this, uhm
this project will serve as my pilot project
the first project i will upload to github out of the 10s of programs I've created (first JAVA programme though)

uhm, i've been doing things the wrong way and i want to follow the right path now or the path of best practice rather

i had this idea that i only wanna display worthwhile projects to github, but that's not a bright idea

but here goes nothing i guess
